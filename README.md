# Lesson(s) Learned
I did not think I was ready to tackle a project of this size. Taking breaks was huge and tackling one step at a time.

SLOW down, reading instructions and requirements slow and carefully.

English to Syntax, putting what I am doing or planning to do into English first then coding with the proper Syntax.

Brain cells were harmed in the making of this project.
